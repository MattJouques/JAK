# Description
JAK stands for Just Another Kneeboard. It is a fully featured VFR pre-flight planning application that is designed to minimise the effort and margins of error in preparing a VFR PLOG (Visual Flight Rules Pilot log), including the sourcing of winds aloft data. Further to that, the application will calculate key aircraft performance such as take off / landing distances, weight & balance calculations, fuel calculations and prepare a basic pre-flight briefing. 

Anyone who has studied for their private pilot certificate / PPL will be used to whizz-wheels (E6-B), plotters, rulers, winds aloft charts and lots of double checking. JAK rolls all of these elements into one application that will enable you to build, import and save routes for later use, that can be update to reflect current forecast conditions within minutes. 

# Features
 * Planning dashboard
 * PLOG (Pilot Log)
 * Performance charts
 * Weight and Balance calculations
 * gpx file import
 * winds aloft data
 * NOTAMs
 * METARs and TAFs
 * Unit Conversion tool
 * User configurable units of measure
 * Application self Tests

# Using JAK
There are several components to the application, with a significant number of settings and configuration options that can be applied. The application will guide you to complete the required data inputs to achieve the desired outputs. Do not be daunted by the scale of options within the application. You will get out, much more than you put in - Proper Preparation and Planning, Prevents Poor Performance - with the outputs of this application at hand, you can focus more on the journey, still knowing you have prepared. 

# Import functions
Currently only tested with routes exported from Air Navigation Pro. Please submit a feature request via the support forums if you would like us to add support for other applications. 

Once a Route has been plotted and defined within Air Navigation Pro, export the route via email (we will look to make this a slicker process in the future and are working with the producers of Air Navigation Pro to consider better integration). Select open-with on the attached xxx.gpx file and choose 'JAK'. The route will then be imported into the JAK database. 

Please note, that only the ID's, names, Latitude and Longitude for each waypoint are included in this gpx file. All of the related route calculations will be performed by JAK. 

# Navigation
This application is intended for use by general aviation pilots for VFR (visual flight rules) flights. As a result, the calculations and navigation outputs are designed to be consistent with the pre-flight Navigation planning activities conducted by a private pilot for cross country flights. 

## Bearing and distance calculations
Bearing and distance calculations are all performed using Rhumb lines. This will provide inconsistencies when compared to some GPS devices and online calculators, where great circle calculations are often used. Rhumb line calculations provide a constant heading for the duration of the flight leg (the track crosses all lines of latitude at the same angle). In very long distance flights the difference between great circle and Rhumb line distances are still negligible, for example for a flight from KLAX (Los Angeles International) to KJFK (John F Kennedy Airport in New York); Great Circle distance = 2144 Nm, Rhumb line distance = 2165 Nm.

# Help and Support
The application will perform a series of self tests on startup to check the status of the database and also to run known scenarios through the key calculation functions to ensure that the expected results are being returned. If you receive an error message or encounter an issue with the application, please refer to the support forums for details on how to resolve. 

We are happy to consider including additional features within the application and so If you have a feature request, please log it on the support forums.
